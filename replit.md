# Overview

This is a frontend web project for a lifestyle/fashion brand called "ùïª’è·éΩ·èü·éªœ¥ùïØ’Ñ’ák" (PsychoDuck). The application appears to be a modern, dark-themed website with neon green accents, featuring product cards and brand collections. The project uses pure HTML/CSS with animations and responsive design principles. There's also evidence of a concept design for a similar brand called "Rascal" that uses TailwindCSS for styling.
